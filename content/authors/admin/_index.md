  I'm a Computer Engineer focused on technology development. I consider
  myself very experienced in new things about web developing, mobile
  applications, database management and testing of new programming
  languages. I'm currenty studying the seventh semester of my
  undergraduated degree at UNAM. However, I never stop there, I enjoy
  mathematics and logics, always finding an answer for everything.
